3. Enable Google Drive API
4. Create a service account and download the JSON key
5. Create a shared drive folder for photos
6. Share the folder with the service account email

### 4. Environment Variables

1. Copy `env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in all the required values:

```env
# Firebase Configuration
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abcdef123456

# Firebase Admin SDK (for serverless functions)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_service_account_email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour private key here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

# Google Drive API (uses same Firebase service account)
GOOGLE_DRIVE_SHARED_DRIVE_ID=your_shared_drive_id
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your_shared_drive_folder_id

# Admin Configuration (frontend)
VITE_ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@blazingfeathers.com,another_admin@example.com

```

### 5. Firestore Security Rules

Set up the following Firestore security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Birds are publicly readable, only admins can write
    match /birds/{birdId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.token.email in ['admin@blazingfeathers.com'];
      
      // Photos are publicly readable, owners and admins can write
      match /photos/{photoId} {
        allow read: if true;
        allow write: if request.auth != null && 
          (resource.data.uploadedBy == request.auth.uid || 
           request.auth.token.email in ['admin@blazingfeathers.com']);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Deploy to Netlify

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. The build command is automatically set in `netlify.toml`: `npm run build`
4. Set the publish directory: `dist`
5. Add all environment variables in Netlify dashboard
6. Set Node.js version to 18.20.8 in Netlify build settings
7. Deploy!

**Note**: Function dependencies are included in the main package.json to avoid memory issues during build.

**Admin Configuration**: Set `VITE_ADMIN_EMAILS` to a comma-separated list of admin email addresses. These users will have admin privileges in the application. Make sure to set this environment variable in both your local `.env` file and in your Netlify dashboard.

**Google Drive Setup**: The app uses the same Firebase service account for Google Drive access. You need to set up a shared drive and provide both the shared drive ID and folder ID within that drive.
